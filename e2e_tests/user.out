root:/$ root:/$ test:/$ root:/$ su: Invalid user
root:/$ adduser: The user already exists
root:/$ root:/$ deluser: The user does not exist
root:/$ WARNING: You are just about to delete the root account
Usually this is never required as it may render the whole system unusable
If you really want this, call deluser with parameter --force
(but this `deluser` does not allow `--force`, haha)
Stopping now without having performed any action
root:/$ bye, root
